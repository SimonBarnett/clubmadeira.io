Today we are making a flask. The Flask App is /madeira.py
My git hub is here:
https://github.com/SimonBarnett/Madeira/
There are four SPA permission based pages in /templates.
	/admin
	/community
	/merchant
	/partner
Routes are defined with blueprints in /bluprints
The app uses a login_required decorator from utils/auth.py for permissions
The main entry point of the app is /, which uses the /login template
from there, depending on user permssion, we redirect to one of the templates above.

# Transfer Request (XREQ) - Navigation and Initialization Fixes in Flask Application

## Current Requirement
The objective is to address two primary issues in the Flask application's navigation and initialization behavior:
- **Navigation Issue**: When navigating from `/admin` to a role-based page (e.g., `/partner`), the URL updates as expected. However, when returning to `/admin`, the URL does not update and remains stuck on the previous page (e.g., `/partner`).
- **Initialization Errors**: Console logs report recurring "Initialize function not found" errors during page loads, suggesting a problem with script timing or execution.

## Progress Made
Efforts to resolve these issues include the following updates:
- **Modified `page-load.js`**:
  - Updated the `handleHrefClick` function to use `history.pushState` for all navigation events, including back navigation to `/admin`, ensuring consistent URL updates.
  - Adjusted the script to explicitly call the `initialize` function after updating page content (either the content container or full body), reinitializing the page and reattaching event listeners.
- **Console Log Review**: Analyzed console logs to trace the event sequence and confirm that the changes address the identified issues.

## Next Steps
To finalize the fixes, the following actions are proposed:
- **Deploy the Updated File**: Replace the existing `page-load.js` with the updated version containing the navigation and initialization fixes.
- **Test Navigation**: Verify that navigating between pages (e.g., `/admin` to `/partner` and back) correctly updates the URL and resolves the initialization errors.
- **Validate Content Container**: Ensure the HTML structure includes a consistent content container (e.g., `.content-container`) for dynamic updates, and adjust the selector in `page-load.js` if necessary.

## Abbreviations Used
Here’s my understanding of the abbreviations we’re using in our interactions:
- **CREQ (Confirm Requirement)**: A step to confirm the requirement and summarize the current understanding, ensuring we’re aligned on the task before moving forward.
- **NF (Next File)**: Refers to the next file in the sequence to be worked on, typically based on a list provided in the CREQ.
- **AMD (Amendment)**: Indicates the process of amending a file with specific changes, requiring the full, updated version of the file to be provided with the amendments included.
